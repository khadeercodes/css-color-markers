# CSS Color Markers

CSS project that creates realistic **colored marker pens** using gradients, shadows, and layouts.

## What I Learned

- Using `linear-gradient()` for colorful effects
- Applying `box-shadow` to add glow around objects
- Using `inline-block` layout for horizontal alignment
- Styling with HSL, RGB, and HEX colors
